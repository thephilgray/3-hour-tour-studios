        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

Our specialty is providing Professional Studio Musicians who are virtuosos at their instruments. These professionals are also uniquely successful in their ability to convey that knowledge through a proven teaching style, using techniques that our clients have come to enjoy and truly learn from, regardless of age or level of skill.

Many of our customers prefer the convenience of our company traveling to their homes with the necessary tools. Moreover, you may choose in-studio instruction or mobile instruction.

Both offer the same success yet you must decide which is the most convenient and money saving option. Our offices can explain the differences and you can decide on your ideal package, all of which are priced very affordably.

Whether it's guitar (acoustic, electric, 4-5 or 6 string bass, classical, rhythm or lead), a small trap set of jazz percussion drums to a Neil Pert of RUSH double bass, 10 TOM TOM extravaganza or somewhere in the middle, we guarantee you will show improvement with each session!
